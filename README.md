# My-proyects

Hi! I'm **Sergio Eduardo González Barraza**, a software engeneering student from Tec de Monterrey in México. 

This is my github, the place where I store and showcase all the proyects I've worked on related to programming. Welcome!

This github includes (for now): 
- MATLAB School proyects (in [MATLAB branch](https://github.com/SergioGzzBrz/My-proyects/tree/MATLAB)). 

It will soon include (By January 2023):
- Data analysis and machine learning proyect of Amazon's search results

Feel free to test, download and explore the documents and branches of what I've done.

You can also find my CV in main branch (this one).
