# My-projects

Hi! I'm **Sergio Eduardo González Barraza**, a software engineering student from Tec de Monterrey in México. 

This is my GitHub, the place where I store and showcase all the projects I've worked on related to programming. Welcome!

This GitHub includes (for now): 
- MATLAB School projects (in [MATLAB branch](https://github.com/SergioGzzBrz/My-proyects/tree/MATLAB)). 

It will soon include (By January 2023):
- Data analysis and machine learning project of Amazon's search results

Feel free to test, download and explore the documents and branches of what I've done.
